## Descriptions
ü§ñüëã Hey there!

As part of my Flutter 100 days challenge, I developed an app for some practice. It was a great opportunity for me to explore animation techniques, which I used for the first time in this project. üé¨
While I was browsing through the Dribble website, I stumbled upon an interesting UI design that caught my attention. Although it was simple, I thought it had potential, so I decided to tweak and enhance it to my liking. üí°

Overall, I'm pretty excited about how this project turned out and I hope you will enjoy it too! ‚ù§Ô∏è
